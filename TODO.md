# Things to learn in `Julia`

* ~~Learn to use the `Logging` module.~~

* ~~Learn to use macros, e.g. `@mymacro` => expansion~~

* Make a macro for a self-made module. 

* Types and their heirarchy.

* Creating structures.

* The effects of multiple dispatch/finding an implementation suitable for multiple dispatch to evaluate it's usefulness.

* Learn to use the operations related to multi-dimensional arrays.

* ~~Learn how to use serialize.~~

* ~~Find an application for serialization.~~ Save variables in directory and reload them later in a different REPL session. 

* Memory-mapped IO, allows the loading of values based on a file in a directory that is too big to fit in RAM. 

* ~~Become familiar with good Hygiene practices for macros (i.e. not expanding macros out and making conflicting macro names).~~ These practices seem a bit esoteric for my use (currently). 

* Learn to use `DataFrames.jl`
